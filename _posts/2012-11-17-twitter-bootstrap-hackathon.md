# {{ page.title }}

Lets-work-in-pairs workshop to get Twitter Bootstrap based website up and running. We'll start with the very basic stuff - downloading the Bootstrap and, depending on our performance, progressing through HTML/CSS coding to making our site talk to a primitive [CRUD][crud] backend. I hope we'll touch the [Responsive Web Design][responsive] topic a little bit too.

Please, devote some time to review the [Bootstrap][bootstrap] documentation and refresh your CSS and JavaScript skills.

Everyone interested in modern, adaptive, responsive website template is invited: designers, web developers, html coders, backend developers. Anyone can do a pretty website nowadays!
