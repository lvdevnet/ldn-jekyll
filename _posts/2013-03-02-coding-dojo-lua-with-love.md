title: 'Coding Dojo: Lua with LÖVE'
---

# {{ page.title }}

[Lua][lua] is a lightweight and extensible language that is designed to be embedded for scripting. Which is why it's very popular [in game dev][use-cases]. This language is a good and simple example of how to do a lot when you have a little.

[LÖVE][love] is a spiffy framework for 2D games in Lua. It's cross-platform, performant, completely free, and great for [small games and prototyping][games].

We'll be using LÖVE to animate an abstract scene, complete with music and special effects, in a Coding Dojo format.

To get a feel for both the language and the framework, check out these links:

* [Download Lua][download]
* Introductory topics in the Lua Tutorial Directory
* [LÖVE Wiki][wiki] (explains how to start and provides a bunch of tutorials)

To get an idea of what the Coding Dojo events are, just browse past meetups history. The link to Past Meetups is on the left, below our logo; or check out [these slides][coding-dojo].
