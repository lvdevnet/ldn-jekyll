# {{ page.title }}

We started half a year ago and there are already things to retrospect and improve.

We have vision for next year events, including The Big One. We would love to see cross-community involvment.

I gladly ask Ryby, Python, Web, Oracle, Microsoft, FP community leaders and participants to join us in this relaxed evening to discuss plans and event calendar for the next year.

Good bear and snacks at Bon Vivant! Bring your wallet, though :)
