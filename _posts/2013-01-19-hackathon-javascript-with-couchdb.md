title: 'Hackathon: JavaScript with CouchDB'
---

# {{ page.title }}

CouchDB is a simple tool. Simple tools can be used creatively.

We'll have a small task to implement for our entertainment. In the process you'll touch the core concepts of CouchDB, such as:

1. Structured schema-less storage;
2. Btree-based views to lookup and summarize the data;
3. Transformations: views and lists written in JavaScript;
4. REST interface over HTTP;
5. Design documents.

Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, jQuery, and HTTP protocol is required to get most of the event. I also suggest to take a look on CouchDB documentation by reading the following:

* [http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Technical_Overview](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Technical_Overview)
* [http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views)

In case you're still hungry after reading the above, try to grok:

* [http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation)
* [http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_view_API](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_view_API)

**Bring a laptop.** The preferred way to code is to work in pairs but solo is fine too. You can even form teams and try social coding.

To get an idea of what the Hackathon events are, just browse past meetups history. The link to Past Meetups is on the left, below our logo.
