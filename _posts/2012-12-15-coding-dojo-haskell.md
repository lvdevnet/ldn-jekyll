title: 'Coding Dojo: Haskell'
---

1. Downoad Haskell.
2. Learn Haskell.
3. Fly!

We'll cover a little bit of 1st and 2nd to get you started for the 3rd.

Seriously, though, FP is quite often misunderstood or cited out of context as panacea for every programmer's problem.

We'll have a small task to challenge in functional-style and time to discuss what are real strengths and weaknesses of Haskell and the tools proposed by the FP movement.

Please, allocate some time to get familiar with Haskell. The more you dig into it, the better for the event. To get you started:

* [Learn Haskell Fast and Hard][fast-hard] – a tutorial for the impatient.
* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!][lyah] – a \[rather lengthy\] book for those, who never tried FP before.

During the event we'll have two documentation resources at our disposal: a [cheat sheet][cheat-sheet] and an API search engine, [Hoogle][hoogle], opened in a browser tab.

To get an idea of what the Coding Dojo events are, just browse past meetups history. The link to Past Meetups is on the left, below our logo.
